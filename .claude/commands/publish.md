# /publish — prepare an npm release of @keenmate/pure-css

You are preparing this package for `npm publish`. **Do not run `npm publish`** — the user logs in and publishes manually.

This command follows the canonical `/publish` structure defined in the BlissFramework component guidelines at
`web-components/publish-command.md`. Sections marked **[canonical]** are byte-identical across every
component's `/publish`; sections marked **[per-repo]** are customized for this repo's layout, build, and tests.

## Argument [canonical]

The release type: **$ARGUMENTS**

Must be one of:

- `rc` — ship the WIP rc as-is. The topmost CHANGELOG heading (e.g. `## [1.0.0-rc02] — 2026-08-05`) gets ` [PUBLISHED]` appended.
- `release` — promote a WIP rc to a final release. `X.Y.Z-rcN` → `X.Y.Z`. CHANGELOG heading is renamed to match the new version.
- `patch` — SemVer patch bump. Drops any `-rc` suffix.
- `minor` — SemVer minor bump. Drops `-rc`. Resets patch.
- `major` — SemVer major bump. Drops `-rc`. Resets minor and patch.

If missing or invalid, stop and ask the user which one to use (don't guess).

## Repo layout [per-repo]

Single-package repo, everything at root:

- **`./package.json`** — `version` field is the source of truth.
- **`./CHANGELOG.md`** — at the root. Topmost `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` heading **without** the `[PUBLISHED]` marker is the WIP section. Note the date separator is an **em-dash** (` — `, U+2014), matching the existing headings.
- **`./README.md`** — at the root. Carries `## What's New in X.Y.Z` sections near the top (one per release, the **two most recent** retained). **This repo omits the `v` prefix** on the version — headings read `## What's New in 1.0.0-rc02`, not `vX.Y.Z`.
- **`./dist/css/`** — **committed** (not gitignored). Produced by `npm run build` (Sass). Six artifacts: `pure-css.css` (the bundle), `base.css`, `reboot.css`, `scrollbars.css`, `grid.css`, `utilities.css`. Because `dist/` is vendored for toolchain-free consumers, a rebuild's output **must be staged and committed** with the release.
- **`./src/scss/`** — the SCSS source; published with the package (consumers may `@use` it).

## CHANGELOG convention in this repo [canonical]

There is **no `## [Unreleased]` section**. The WIP section is the topmost `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` heading without a `[PUBLISHED]` tag. Already-released sections carry `[PUBLISHED]` at the end of their heading:

```
## [1.0.0-rc02] — 2026-08-05                  ← WIP, the one you're shipping
### Added
- ...

## [1.0.0-rc01] — 2026-08-04 [PUBLISHED]
### Fixed
- ...
```

Publishing the WIP section means **appending ` [PUBLISHED]`** to its heading — exact format: `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD [PUBLISHED]` (em-dash date separator). The next development cycle creates a fresh `## [next-version] — <date>` heading on its first CHANGELOG edit.

**This repo hasn't published under the `[PUBLISHED]` convention yet** (it's still at rc), so no sections carry the tag. Don't retro-add it to older sections — only finalize the section you're shipping. Substring searches for `PUBLISHED` still work once the convention is in place.

## Resolve versions [canonical]

Read `./package.json` `version` as `CURRENT_VERSION`.
Read the topmost `## [X.Y.Z...]` heading from `./CHANGELOG.md` as `WIP_VERSION` (the version the latest WIP section is tagged for).

Compute `NEW_VERSION`:

| Argument | Logic |
|---|---|
| `rc` | If `CURRENT_VERSION` matches `X.Y.Z-rcN`, `NEW_VERSION = CURRENT_VERSION` (no bump — we're shipping what's already in package.json). If `CURRENT_VERSION` is not an rc, stop and ask the user (they probably wanted `release`/`patch`/etc.). |
| `release` | If `CURRENT_VERSION` matches `X.Y.Z-rcN`, `NEW_VERSION = X.Y.Z`. Otherwise stop. |
| `patch` | Strip any `-rcN`, then bump patch. |
| `minor` | Strip any `-rcN`, then bump minor, reset patch. |
| `major` | Strip any `-rcN`, then bump major, reset minor and patch. |

If `WIP_VERSION` ≠ `NEW_VERSION` (e.g. the WIP is `X.Y.Z-rcN` but the user asked for `release`), the CHANGELOG heading rename in step 3 also re-tags the section to `NEW_VERSION` — call this out in the report so the user notices.

## Steps (in order)

### 0. Preflight — branch + remote drift check [per-repo]

**Run this before anything else — before resolving versions, before any edit.** This
is the guard against the recurring trap: publishing from a stale `prod` (another
machine pushed commits you don't have), which silently drops their fixes from the
release. This bit 1.1.0 — the theme `$base-*` override fix had been pushed to
`origin/prod` from another machine, the local branch was behind, and the published
tarball missed it (it took a `1.1.1` to ship).

- **Confirm the branch.** Run `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. Releases are cut
  from **`prod`** — that's this repo's trunk (there is **no `main`** on the remote).
  If HEAD is not `prod`, **stop** and tell the user to `git switch prod` (or confirm
  they really intend to release from another branch) before continuing.
- **Fetch and compare against the remote.** Run:
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git status
  git log --oneline prod..origin/prod   # commits on the remote you DON'T have
  git log --oneline origin/prod..prod   # commits you have that aren't pushed
  ```
  - If `prod..origin/prod` is **non-empty**, local `prod` is **behind or diverged** —
    **stop**. Do not bump, edit, or build. Report the missing commits and tell the
    user to integrate first (`git pull --rebase origin prod`, or merge), then re-run
    `/publish`. Publishing from behind is exactly what drops another machine's work.
  - If `prod..origin/prod` is empty (local is up to date or purely ahead), proceed.
- Note anything `git status` surfaces (uncommitted work) — step 1 handles the
  file-level detail, but flag it here if the tree is dirty in unexpected ways.

### 1. Sanity checks [canonical]

- Run `git status`. The repo intentionally keeps `.claude/` untracked — that's fine. **`dist/` IS tracked here**, so a rebuild later in this flow will show `dist/css/*.css` as modified — that's expected and gets committed with the release. If there are **other** uncommitted changes that aren't `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, `package.json`, or `dist/`, list them and ask the user before continuing. (Typical case: substantive `src/scss/` changes belonging in this release that haven't been committed yet — confirm they're intended for this version before bumping.)
- **Verify the new version isn't already on npm.** Run `npm view @keenmate/pure-css@<NEW_VERSION> version 2>/dev/null` — if it returns the version string, that version is already published and **stop**: bumping over it would fail at publish time and pollute the commit.
- **Verify the registry hasn't drifted past you.** Run `npm view @keenmate/pure-css version` to fetch the latest published version on the `latest` tag; if it's higher than `NEW_VERSION` (e.g. someone shipped from another machine, or there's a registry-vs-local mismatch), warn the user and ask before continuing.
- Confirm the WIP CHANGELOG section has at least one bullet of substantive content under `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Removed`, `### Fixed`, or `### Internal`. If empty, stop — there's nothing meaningful to release.
- Confirm `./README.md` has a `## What's New in WIP_VERSION` section (no `v` prefix). If it's missing, draft one from the CHANGELOG and present it to the user for approval before continuing:
  - Read the WIP CHANGELOG section, distill it to 5–8 scannable bullets covering the Added/Changed themes (paraphrase, don't copy CHANGELOG bullets verbatim — those are exhaustive; What's New is the highlight reel). Pure internal refactors and Fixed-only entries don't need coverage, though headline bug fixes worth advertising are worth a bullet.
  - **Follow the canonical "What's New" format** defined in the BlissFramework component guidelines (`web-components/readme-structure.md` → "`## What's New in X.Y.Z` — canonical format"). Concretely, adapted to this repo:
    - **Heading:** `## What's New in NEW_VERSION` — **no `v` prefix** (this repo's established style), no backticks around the version, no date.
    - **Each bullet:** `- **<area> — <one-line headline>** — <engineer-level prose, 3–8 sentences>`. Bold-wrapped lead phrase, then a true em-dash (` — `, U+2014 with surrounding spaces), then a prose body explaining *what changed*, *why* (regression history / motivation), *what surface is affected* (concrete file / variable / class names listed inline, e.g. `reboot.scss`, `--base-accent-color`, `.pa-col-1-3`), and *the mechanism* (the technique used). Plain hyphens or en-dashes fail the canonical check.
    - **No `### ` sub-headings** inside a What's New section — no `### Added` / `### Fixed` lifted from the CHANGELOG. It's a flat bullet list.
    - **Reference implementation:** the existing `## What's New in 1.0.0-rc02` / `1.0.0-rc01` sections at the top of this repo's `README.md` are the canonical shape — mirror that voice and structure.
  - Show the user the proposed draft as plain markdown in your reply. Ask whether to (a) insert as-is, (b) edit, or (c) abort so they can write it themselves.
  - Only proceed past step 1 once the user approves the draft (or supplies their own). On approval, insert the section directly above the current top `## What's New in X.Y.Z` heading in `./README.md`, then continue.
  - Do not silently insert the draft without confirmation — release highlights are a writing call and the user owns the voice.

### 2. Bump version (if needed) [canonical]

If `NEW_VERSION` ≠ `CURRENT_VERSION`, edit `./package.json` and change `"version": "CURRENT_VERSION"` to `"version": "NEW_VERSION"`.

For `rc` arg this is normally a no-op — version was bumped earlier in the development cycle.

### 3. Finalize CHANGELOG [canonical]

In `./CHANGELOG.md`:

- If `WIP_VERSION` ≠ `NEW_VERSION` (e.g. promoting `X.Y.Z-rcN` → `X.Y.Z`), rename the WIP heading from `## [WIP_VERSION] — <date>` to `## [NEW_VERSION] — <today>` (today's date from system context).
- If `WIP_VERSION` == `NEW_VERSION`, leave the bracketed version alone but update the date to today **if** the existing date is stale (more than a few days old). The WIP date is usually whatever day the section was opened; refresh it so the changelog reflects the actual ship date.
- In either case, **append ` [PUBLISHED]`** to the heading so it reads exactly: `## [NEW_VERSION] — YYYY-MM-DD [PUBLISHED]` (keep the em-dash date separator).
- Leave all bullet content untouched.
- **Do not** create an empty new WIP section — the next dev cycle's first CHANGELOG edit will create one.

### 4. Update README "What's New" — only if version changed [canonical]

In `./README.md`:

- If the existing `## What's New in WIP_VERSION` section's version differs from `NEW_VERSION` (e.g. promoting `X.Y.Z-rcN` → `X.Y.Z`), rename its heading to `## What's New in NEW_VERSION` (no `v` prefix). (No content rewrites — the text was already curated for this release.)
- Then count the `## What's New in X.Y.Z` headings. If there are more than **two**, delete the oldest ones so only the **two most recent** remain (the just-finalized one plus the one before it).

For `rc` arg this is normally a no-op on the heading itself — only trims if someone left an extra-old section behind.

### 5. Validate README reflects the release [canonical]

Read both the finalized CHANGELOG section and the matching `What's New in NEW_VERSION` section. Every **Added** or **Changed** bullet in the CHANGELOG that represents a user-facing feature or behavior change should have a corresponding hit in the What's New section (paraphrased, not verbatim). Pure internal refactors and `Fixed`-only entries don't need coverage, though headline bug fixes worth advertising (e.g. "standalone consumers no longer render 1.6× too large") are worth a bullet.

If you find a significant CHANGELOG entry that isn't reflected in What's New, add a bullet for it. If the section ends up with more than ~8 bullets after this pass, condense — What's New should be scannable, not exhaustive.

### 6. Validate CHANGELOG entries match recent work [canonical]

Find the previous `[PUBLISHED]` tag in CHANGELOG (the version just before NEW_VERSION) and locate the commit that bumped to it — usually a commit whose subject starts with `v<previous-version>` or references that version. Run `git log --oneline <previous-publish-commit>..HEAD` to list commits since. (If nothing has published under the `[PUBLISHED]` convention yet, use the previous CHANGELOG section's bump commit as the boundary.)

Also check `git diff` (or `git status`) for any uncommitted source work outside the files you're editing in this command.

For every substantive commit or uncommitted change, verify the WIP CHANGELOG section mentions it. If something significant is missing, **stop and ask the user** before finalizing — don't invent entries on their behalf. Pure example/doc tweaks and trivial typo fixes don't need entries.

### 7. Tests [per-repo]

**This repo has no test suite** — it's pure SCSS→CSS with no JS runtime. The build (step 8) is the gate: if Sass compiles all six artifacts without error, the release is sound. There is nothing to run here; proceed to the build.

### 8. Build the package [per-repo]

Run `npm run build` (or `make build`). This runs Sass for each entry point and emits, into `dist/css/`:
- `pure-css.css` (the full bundle), `base.css`, `reboot.css`, `scrollbars.css`, `grid.css`, `utilities.css`.

If the build errors, stop and report.

After build, do a quick smoke check on the emitted artifacts:
- All six `dist/css/*.css` files exist and are non-empty.
- `dist/css/base.css` contains `:root` with `--base-` custom properties (the theming contract actually emitted).
- `dist/css/pure-css.css` contains both the reboot (`font-size:10px`) and grid (`.pa-row`) output (the bundle is complete).

`make sizes` optionally prints the artifact byte sizes for a sanity glance.

### 9. Verify the package contents [per-repo]

Run `npm pack --dry-run` and confirm the file list includes:

- `dist/css/` (the six built CSS files)
- `src/scss/` (the SCSS source, exposed via the `./scss` export)
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `package.json`

If anything user-facing is missing or anything private leaked in (e.g. `Makefile`, `.claude/`, `node_modules/`), stop and report — the `files` field in `package.json` controls this and the leak needs fixing before publish.

### 10. Commit [canonical]

Stage:

- `./CHANGELOG.md`
- `./README.md`
- `./package.json`
- `./dist/` — **yes, stage it here.** Unlike most component repos, `dist/` is committed in pure-css so consumers can vendor the built CSS without a Sass toolchain. The rebuilt artifacts from step 8 must go in the release commit.

Commit message format:

```
vNEW_VERSION - <one-line summary of the headline change>

<grouped bullets paraphrased from the CHANGELOG section — split into the same
groups the CHANGELOG used: Added, Fixed, Changed, Internal, etc. Keep bullets
terse; full prose lives in the CHANGELOG.>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### 11. Report [canonical]

Report back with:

- The new version number
- The commit SHA
- The exact commands to publish. **Pick the right one for the arg type:**
  - For `rc` (publishing a pre-release):
    ```
    npm login          # if not already logged in
    make publish-rc    # npm publish --tag rc (after a clean rebuild)
    ```
    The `--tag rc` is critical — without it npm assigns the `latest` dist-tag, which would make the pre-release the default install for everyone running `npm install @keenmate/pure-css`. With `--tag rc` (what `make publish-rc` does), the `latest` tag stays put and consumers opt in via `@rc` or pinning the exact version.
  - For `release` / `patch` / `minor` / `major` (publishing a stable release):
    ```
    npm login          # if not already logged in
    make publish       # npm publish as latest (after a clean rebuild)
    ```
    No `--tag` needed — it correctly lands as `latest`.
  - Note: `make publish-rc` / `make publish` run `clean build` before publishing, so they re-emit `dist/` from source — the committed `dist/` and the published `dist/` are guaranteed to match.
- A reminder that the CHANGELOG `[PUBLISHED]` tag is now in place — if `npm publish` fails, the user should revert both the tag (CHANGELOG heading) and the version bump (`package.json`) before retrying, since the registry will refuse to re-publish the same version.

## Things not to do [canonical]

- **Do not run `npm publish`.** The user publishes manually after `npm login` (via `make publish-rc` / `make publish`).
- **Do not push to git remote.** The commit stays local until the user pushes.
- **Do not create an empty `[Unreleased]` or new WIP heading** in CHANGELOG after finalizing — the next dev cycle's first edit creates the next heading.
- **Do not retro-fix older CHANGELOG sections** that are missing the `[PUBLISHED]` tag — only finalize the section you're shipping.
- **Do not silently insert a drafted What's New section.** If you draft one in Step 1 because it's missing, you must present it and wait for explicit approval (or edits) before inserting — the writing voice is the user's call, even when you're handing them a starting point.
- **Do not keep more than two `## What's New in X.Y.Z` sections in the README.** Step 4 trims older ones; if you see three or more after Step 4, you missed one.
- **Do not skip the build step** — without it the committed `dist/` is stale and the publish would ship outdated artifacts (or a `dist/` out of sync with source).
- **Do not invent CHANGELOG entries** to cover commits you find; ask the user if something's missing.
- **Do not bump if there's nothing meaningful in the WIP section** — stop and explain.

### Repo-specific don'ts

- **Do stage `dist/`** — it's the one repo where the built output belongs in the commit. (The inverse of most component repos.)
- **Do not add a `v` prefix to `## What's New` headings** — this repo's convention is `## What's New in X.Y.Z` without the `v`.
- **Do not switch the CHANGELOG date separator to a hyphen** — this repo uses an em-dash (` — `) in `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` headings.
